Windows 10 Color Changer
------------------------

### Description
A simple script to freely customize Immersive Windows 10 Color Scheme allowing
creation of unsupported accent colors.

This script should work with any Windows 10 version, but was only tested on
Windows 10, version 1903 and 1909.

### Usage
To use this script run the Command Prompt and type `ColorChanger.cmd` to get
current color scheme values and an usage information.

#### Changing one of desired color values
To change one of color values type `ColorChanger.cmd <color_number>
<desired_color_hex>`.

Example:
```
ColorChanger.cmd 5 000000
```
This will change color 5 to black. The change may not be reflected immediately,
in this case you need to relogin to see it.

To restore previous values of the color scheme, use Windows Settings application
to apply one of default colors.
